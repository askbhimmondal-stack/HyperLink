# HyperLink

Here’s a super simple version of the main points about apps that provide link shortener facilities:

Makes long links very short (easy to share on WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS, etc.)
You can make custom short links with your name or brand (example: pooja.link/sale)
Shows how many people clicked the link
Tells you where clicks came from (city, country, mobile or computer)
Creates QR code automatically for every short link
You can change where the link goes later (without changing the short link)
Some apps let you add password to the link
Works nicely on phone — just share link to the app →
